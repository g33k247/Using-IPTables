How to import a VM to an appliance:

- Move the exported .ova file to the new host.
- Open VirtualBox.
- Click File | Import Appliance.
- Browse to the .ova file.
- Click Next.
- Review the Appliance settings.
- Click Import.

When the import completes (this process takes significantly less time than exporting), the VM is ready to start up and use.
