# description
This tool was inspired by and borrowed heavily from the PIVOT Challenges, specifically the work of Wilmington University (Eric Arnoth).

# contents
Files included as part of the repository:

- iptables_firewall_project (project plan)
- iptables_network_diagram_v1.pdf (virtual network diagram, created using draw.io)
- Building the Lab on a Windows 10 Host (how-to document on building the virtual lab environment)

# supporting procedures
How to import a VM to an appliance:

- Move the exported .ova file to the new host.
- Open VirtualBox.
- Click File | Import Appliance.
- Browse to the .ova file.
- Click Next.
- Review the Appliance settings.
- Click Import.

When the import completes (this process takes significantly less time than exporting), the VM is ready to start up and use.
